Firmware functions: 

- Automatic calibration of the keyboard on the first boot,
- Automatic scale calibration by any mass of the weight set for example 10g weight / 20g weight,

Menu that allows user to set the following functions parameters:

0. Ability to save 10 different configurations depending on the type of ammunition and gunpowder types in relation to the weight that we want to achiev,  
1. Ability to set the Units Grains (Gn) / Grams (g) as a default value to take measurements,
2. Recalibration Shell Load Scale,
3. Enable - Autotare,
4. Set point when Shell Load Scale shoud start to dosing in more slowly way and more accurate to get finall dosage,
5. Set the point when Shell Load Scale shoud start dosing super slowly way and in maximum accurate way to get finall dosage,
6. Set the Fast dosing speed,
7. Set the super accurate slow dosing speed,
8. Set the tolerance value that is acceptable by user / Maximum weighted dosage deviation,
9. Set timout for dosing,
10. Set compensation value,
11. Reset to defaults,
12. Ability to upgrade firmware.

Dashboard:

1. Set the dosage to weight (gn/g)
2. Current actual weight of the dosage,
3. Tare Shell Load manually,
4. START/STOP Dosing,
5. Information about:
	- Dosing process Finished returning OK,
	- Dosing process Finished but weight is Overdosed,
	- Dosing process took too long and give an error of Timeout.





What is needed:

There are two options:

A)
You have to print on 3d Printers in two technologies SLA / FDM or just on SLA Printer:

Firstly Print 3 main components:

1. On SLA/FDM Printer with the highest possible tolerance
	- BASE,
	- COMPUTER CASE,
	- SCALE

2. ONLY on SLA PRINTER !!! (Don't Print on FDM printer this can generate and accumulate electrostatic charges, leading to ignition of gunpowder.)
	- FUNNEL,
	- MOTOR GEAR,
	- PAN,
	- POWDER TUBE,
	- SNAIL.





B. We can make for you everything - This option will be added in the future.
